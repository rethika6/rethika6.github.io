        <p style="text-align: justify;">I decided to create an assignment tracker because it is something that I would use on a daily basis as a college student. I really enjoy the Apple Watch activity rings so I decided to use that as my base design for tracking progress. The rings use closure, symmetry, common fate, continuity, proximity, and similarity to portray progress. For the functionality, when the user opens the app, they will directly see how far along they are for the assignments they have that week. Then, they can update their progress by swiping up on the assignments tab. I differentiated each iteration by color, using a black and white color scheme with monochromatic colors for the first iteration, a neon theme with a "dark mode" esque idea, and a regular white theme for the last iteration. The colors in the rings are triadic colors on the color wheel. I added a fourth iteration that is completely different from the rest as I thought the rings could get boring. The idea is to gamify completing assignments by raising a pet dragon. After completing assignments on time or early, you can gain points to upgrade and grow your dragon. You can see your progress on the right-hand side of the screen until your next update.</p>
